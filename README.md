plsr approach to extracting water quality data from high frequency spectrophotometric observations

This project uses R, and is focused on learning how to make rational decisions for taking samples to calibrate PLSR models. The metrics we are using to evaluate the quality of the PLSR model are based on Nash-Sutcliffe goodness of fit, and a tool developed by Ritter and Mu√±oz for bootstrapping an assessment of the model's goodness of prediction.
